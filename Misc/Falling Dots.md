## Description

You’ve been invited to participate in a top-secret challenge!
A cryptic investigation launched by a secretive organization called CyberSpaghetti Corp.
The company has recently unveiled a new AI-powered communication device.
They claim it is able to convey messages in a truly mesmerizing way.
Using these visual elements the human brain gets easily deranged.
It’s all a part of their next-generation AI communication system,
which promises Predictive Network Guards using Reinforced Guard Bots.
But I can't find any of those features!

## Write-up

We can see a dot falling down (gif), but if you notice it keeps going a little bit more to the right. So we have to write a script to put all of these dots (pixels) together.
